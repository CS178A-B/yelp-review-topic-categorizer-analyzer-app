When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!\n\nTucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call \"cozy\" or \"charming\" - basically any euphemism for small.\n\nThat being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:\n\n* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.\n* it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them.\n* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to \"just look around\" and \"do whatever.\" \n\nAt such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.","date":"2015-04-15 05:21:16"},

My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn't. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said \"you know what? That's fine.\", paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.\n\nBottom line: DO NOT GO HERE. RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!!","date":"2013-12-07 03:16:52"},

We were not disappointed.\n\nI am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.\n\nI ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.\n\nThe ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.\n\nTldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.\n\nUpdate: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji. This is hands down the best Indian place in Pittsburgh - the bhaji is to die for. Make sure you sprinkle lemon on top and have the pav with mango chutney.","date":"2018-02-01 19:15:00"},

I was hungry and Caesars Palace was a across from where I was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, I walked right in with no waiting. (I will assume now that since its Bobby's place this place can get crowded so I feel the need to note this was a Sunday about 11:45am) Once inside Caesars Palace, I went to the first restaurant I saw, which was this one.  I realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that \"Mr Flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick\" (they were an older couple). I know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nFOOD: fantastic.  I went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  It came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). I am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  I had a side of home fries which were a little burnt but oh well.  The steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. Overall very good. Had a cappuccino too, also very good.

I don't know what the problem is - I have worked in the industry before while in college and I would say front of the house training needs big overhaul.  At any rate, they have lots of TV's and it is closer to us but just plain not good.  I wish they would switch locations with Wild Wing Cafe - also chain-y but much better food and service.","date":"2016-04-11 16:42:13"},

See, we chose not to make reservations, but instead just wing it and see where we could get in. They had some early dining availability, so we jumped on it. Their special New Year's \"Paint the Town Gold\" menu did not disappoint.\n\nLocated in the beautiful Mandalay Bay restaurant row, Kumi is a gorgeous display of style and food artistry. Every course was surprisingly delicious, and plated interestingly.\n\nService was very good, seriously on point. Right up until the dessert course...after 30 minutes of waiting for it, we finally requested the check as we had an event to get to. One of our attendants felt bad and offered to quickly grab it for us but we were in danger of being late so we opted not to take him up on it. \n\nIt's a beautiful, albeit very pricey experience for dinner. We would return for special occasions only.","date":"2017-01-02 05:24:56"},

Oh, how things have changed.\n\nThere are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.\n\nThe biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. \n\nThe \"Space Lounge\" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.\n\nWith their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their \"big draw\" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.\n\nThe arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  \n\nThere's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was \"ha ha\" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.\n\nLadies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.\n\nAs critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called \"Triumph\" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.\n\nThe sad part is, Hilton's one of those \"history rich\" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.\n\nThis place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.","date":"2011-01-09 00:09:50"},

I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.\nI pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!\nI have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.\nI called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.\n\nAnd NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.

This time, I ordered the following - duck crepe (SOOOO good!), shrimp tamale (very flavorful and fresh), salmon (mediocre, at best... and our waiter even told us not to order it... but my friend didn't listen), and halibut (tender, flaky, not fishy at all... and so flavorful!).  The halibut and appetizers were my favorites and I would definitely go and order those again.  We also ordered 3 desserts, which were totally worth it!  Sweet potato pudding (and I don't even like sweet potatoes!), Banana pie tart thingy, and spicy peanut chocolate cake.  mmmmmm would definitely go there for dessert and the appetizers!!! \n\nYou need a reservation for this place.","date":"2012-11-06 06:00:13"},

My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as\nwe looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. To\nme the best part was the granola and that's about it.

Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.\n\nThe ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.\n\nOur waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey.","date":"2014-08-10 23:03:05"},

To sum it up, the experience was so darn good that I wish I had more time on the plane.","date":"2010-01-08 09:36:25"},

I won't deny my dog needed some serious grooming.  We'd brushed him out the night before but he could still use more combing, his hind legs\/butt trimmed up and he had some matts behind his ear.  There are 4 doors at this place, I believe. If you just pull in to the drive way it's not terribly clear until you get closer to the doors and see signs directing you which to go into.  The lobby is cute. I was quickly greeted and I was given a form to complete. The woman doing the grooming introduced herself and I asked that his hind legs and butt get trimmed up and asked that she cut out any matts.  She said it would probably take about 3 hours.  I received a text about 3 1\/2 hours later stating the price would be $80 and if I returned within 8 weeks it would be $65.  I went to pick him up and I was shocked that they shaved him.  His hair was NOT that bad.  Not to mention the hair that was left was not soft as it has been after visiting other groomers.  I didn't say anything because I was so shocked in the moment so I took him home.  We saw our dog paying particular attention to his private area...more so than he usually does.  My husband looked closer and found that he had been nicked a couple of times.  We found a large cut behind one of his ears.  We won't be returning.","date":"2016-03-07 00:34:42"},

This review was tough to give, as it could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars.\n\nLet's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.\n\nI ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi\/sashimi\/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi\/sashimi\/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.\n\nEverything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi\/sashimi\/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.\n\nWhat probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.\n\nFree wifi! Password is the phone number. Perhaps as a sucker for free wifi that might have contributed to the 3-star rating I gave. However, be warned.","date":"2013-07-13 00:57:45"},

I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!\nI don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. \nThe sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. \nOverall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful\/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight \"drawbacks\", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.","date":"2015-06-08 18:56:14"},

I blame the Marriot for most of the mess but the City of Tempe need to plan better for events.\nInside the stadium I found the place to be less than average for Spring Training games.  The food was not good, the customer service was average and we could not hear the speakers very well.  I will stick to other Spring Training facilities to see some games in the future.","date":"2014-04-01 02:10:32"},

I went in, placed my order, and after about 15 minutes, was on my way home. \n\nThe inside is cozy, there is a new hookah lounge upstairs (not technically the same business), for those who might be interested in that. The tables inside were pretty low key, but the kitchen area is open except for some glass, so you get to watch your food prepared while you wait which is always a nice touch. Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. \n\nThe young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly. The gentleman who gave me my food, apologized for the wait (15 minutes is not long in my book, but maybe for some it is), and said that calling ahead is a great option if you're ever in a hurry in the future. \n\nI ordered a lamb and chicken shish kabob. They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored. The green sauce that was at the counter where you pick up your food was perfectly spiced and I put it on EVERYTHING! I appreciate the fresh lemon wedge that was included in my to-go container. \n\nMy only real complaint was the price. It was more than $17 for two kabobs, which I thought was on the expensive side. If they took their prices down around $2, I'd be here way more often that is good for my wallet...","date":"2016-03-06 23:58:31"},

The prime rib was balanced with just the perfect amount of richness and seasoning. I ordered a medium and it was a true medium- the edges were seasoned and done well while the interior was still a soft pink and juicy. My date loved the Yorkshire pudding, I wasn't really a fan, but it was airy and puffed up to perfection. The mushrooms were rich and earthy, the perfect accompaniment. The mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and deliciously well seasoned. No bland taters here.\n\nAll in all, we had a truly wonderful evening at Lawry's LV. We decided to skip dessert because we were stuffed and totally satisfied, so our waiter went the extra mile and boxed up a mini cake for us saying that we couldn't leave without something sweet on our anniversary (!!)

When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was...\"Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now.\"  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.

I told them I'm not a patient here any longer and took my useless glasses home and resolved to find a quality optometry office and start over.

So I called again and toild them to toss my file out and not contact me again for any future appts. \n Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.\n(Note: using fake name here for privacy protection from internet identity thieves.)","date":"2018-07-17 00:21:32"},

Everything from start to finish was pretty much impeccable. \n\nSourdough bread in the shape of leaves were brought out immediately with softened butter in a small ramekin.

It has a thin layer of braised beef ground down to a coarse pate texture, then a thin layer of foie gras, then a layer of prune gelee.  Served with crostini and a small frisee salad.  The slightly slightly saltier beef and the creamy foie went so well together. The prune gelee added that touch of cool sweetness that made it all work together.  A dish I would definitely recommend.\n\nFor our entrees, I got the Steak frites, and Mark H had the Leg of lamb (Gigot d'Agneau.)

The steak was cooked to a perfect mid rare and was tender.  The onions and the compound butter did overpower the steak a bit, though.\n\nMark H's dish on the other hand, was the better of the two.  The roasted leg of lamb was just so tender and flavorful,  the knife cut through the meat like butter.  The lamb was served with flageolet beans and braised escarole.  Our server asked him when he was ordering if he wanted any sides to go with it since it didn't come with a starch but the beans and escarole was enough for an entree portion.  Besides, I know he wanted to save room for dessert.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Banana crepe gateau.  Layers of crepes with banana pastry cream between them, served with salted caramel and french vanilla gelato.   This was pretty amazing as well.  I've had some fantasic gateau de crepes in france and this one really reminded me of being there.  The banana flavor was a bit too subtle for me but that salted caramel was like heaven.  Such an incredible texture to it with that bright kick of salt, damn.  The french vanilla gelato was memorable as well.  Nice silky texture and oh so creamy.\n\nThe next time I'm there,  we really have to try their breakfast.","date":"2016-01-04 04:06:15"},

The salmon salad came with a huge piece of fresh, healthy tasting salmon filet. It was just what I wanted. \n\nThe one wrinkle was that I wanted to swap something out of my salad for avocado instead (which came with the grilled shrimp salad but I wanted salmon, and not shrimp). The server told me they didn't do \"those kinds of substitutions\" but would check anyway. He came back, and affirmed that they couldn't put avocado on my salad unless they charged an extra $2.00. Kind of annoying. I get that if you're Terroni you can have a \"no substitutions\" policy but in this case, how about changing that policy? \n\nThe server really made an effort though, and said he'd bring over some guacamole instead. That was much appreciated :) \n\nThe hourly rentals to use the pool and ping pong tables are pretty pricey ($25\/hour) but it is a really nice space now, with nice, clean washrooms (important!), comfy seats, and lots of TVs.

Our room was the Queen suite that had a stove and full size refrigerator and pullout sofa bed. Check in and check out was a quick and easy process.\n\nFree continental breakfast which, according to my brother, is pretty decent and they offered good food. \n\nOverall, decent and quiet place. Far from the strip, which is good if you're not into partying and the Vegas nightlife.","date":"2016-01-17 19:42:47"},

All the dishes (even the salads) have either meat, fish, poultry or eggs in them. I have heard that this place is good from my friends but I can't join them since there is nothing for vegetarian or vegan people to eat here. Vegetarianism is becoming more popular everyday and restaurants like this one have to learn to adapt and cater the needs and wants of people becoming vegetarians or vegans. Sadly, this is one of many restaurants who fail to understand this change. There are very few places where vegetarian or vegan people can have a proper meal. I'll come here only when there is a proper vegetarian\/vegan menu in place.","date":"2016-08-25 15:37:07"},

I also get a little cautious sometimes as they frequently have multiple questionable looking characters.\n\nPro's:\n- Legendary fries that used to be super huge and gave you great value for your buck\n- Good burgers\n- If you drink, it looks like they have a lot of different kinds of alcohol\n\nCon's:\n- Customer Service? Hahaha. Not here. If you can get more than a fart out of one of the twin's working there, you are ahead of the pack.\n- Dirty, messy tables, crap everywhere.\n- Many questionable characters here. Someone once asked me if I wanted to buy stolen jewelry off them while I was eating. I'm being totally honest too.\n- Their french fry portions have gotten smaller. They used to need two baskets for a large fry and now only need one.\n- Really expensive hot dogs. \n- They have strict limits on ketchup. No I'm not joking. 2 for large fries, 1 for anything less.\n\nI do recommend getting their legendary fries at least once and I do recommend the egg burger, but get it to go and go when it is light out.","date":"2013-09-04 04:35:27"},

My chihuahua\/terrier usually has a lot of anxiety around people and she was nervous at first but didn't bite and by the time I came back she was really calm.

Of course you are \" lost why I feel that way.\" You think its normal to answer a phone call  at a place of business with the greeting \"Speak\" and reply to questions with \"what the hell are you talking about\"'\n\nB. You do not remember anything. I never said anything about 3% or California. I ONLY asked for a specific type of bond, (because not all bond companies are able to provide this specific type of bond) and your reply was \"what the hell are you talking about\". After that short conversation I terminated our conversation as stated in my review, so there was NO talk of California or 3%. I only included my experience with other bail bonds companies in my REVIEW to highlight how easy it was for me to call another business and not be treated so rudely. \n\nC. Thank you for letting me know how poor your customer service is so quickly. Made the decision to go else where easy.
